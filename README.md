# Future Links 

#### (An open source concept to prevent software patenting.)


## What is a Future Link?

A "Future Link" is a concept that introduces a hyperlink or clickable UI element (the Future Link) that leads to content or information that has not yet been created (the Future Content Placeholder), offering a mechanism for users a to signal interest for future content, prioritize and directly or indirectly support content creation, and facilitate user engagement with the yet-to-be-created content (Future Content). The idea is to provide a placeholder for future content, allowing users to express their interest through various Interest Expression Mechanisms such as voting, pledging, or direct payment. Additionlly, even without a direct mechanism to vote for the Future Content, the system can record analytic data and log the clicking of the link as interest.

## Core Components of Future Links

1. **Future Link**: The hyperlink or clickable UI element that leads users to the Future Content Placeholder.
2. **Future Content Placeholder**: The message, UI element, or landing page displayed when a user clicks on a Future Link, informing them that the content they are seeking has not yet been created and presenting options to express interest or provide support for its creation.
3. **Interest Expression Mechanism**: The various ways users can express interest in the creation of the linked content, such as voting, pledging, or providing feedback or passively through analytics.

## Additional Supporting Components

- **Creator Dashboard or other Analytics system**: Any dashboard or interface where content creators can manage their Future Links, view analytics, and respond to user interest. This would be an add-on to the concept of a Future Link.
- **Analytics Tracker**: A component responsible for tracking and recording user interactions with Future Links, such as clicks, votes, pledges, or other expressions of interest.
- **Notification System**: A component that alerts content creators when users express interest in a Future Link, prompting them to take action or respond to the interest.
- **Interest Aggregator**: A component that collects and aggregates user interest data from multiple Future Links, providing content creators with an overview of the most popular or in-demand content ideas.
- **Content Creation Workflow**: A component or set of tools that helps content creators plan, prioritize, and execute the creation of content based on the interest expressed through Future Links.
- **Content Delivery System**: A component responsible for delivering the newly created content to users who expressed interest in it, either through direct access or by notifying them of its availability.
- **Feedback Loop**: A component that allows content creators to gather additional feedback, preferences, or suggestions from users who expressed interest in a Future Link, fostering ongoing engagement and refinement of the content.

## Integration Components

- **API Layer**: A component that provides a standardized interface for integrating Future Links functionality with external platforms, tools, or services.
- **CMS Plugin**: A component that integrates Future Links functionality directly into popular content management systems (CMS) like WordPress, Drupal, or Ghost.
- **Social Sharing Adapter**: A component that allows users to share Future Links on social media platforms, expanding their reach and potentially attracting more interest.
- **Payment Gateway Adapter**: A component that integrates with payment gateways or processors to facilitate direct payments or pledges from users interested in supporting the creation of content.

## Purpose

The primary purposes of "Future Links" are:

1. **Gauging interest:** By tracking user interactions with Future Links through Interest Expression Mechanisms, content creators can assess the demand for specific topics or content ideas.
2. **Prioritizing content creation:** Based on the interest shown by users and aggregated, content creators can prioritize their efforts and focus on creating the most sought-after content or set target pledge/interrest amounts that need to be met in order to begin content production.
3. **Facilitating user engagement:** Future Links allow users to actively participate in shaping the content they want to see, fostering a sense of community and collaboration between creators and their audience.
4. **Directing editorial and production:** Future Links can help content creators save time and resources by focusing on content that is more likely to be well-received by their audience.

## Use Cases

"Future Links" can be particularly useful in various contexts, such as:

- Blogging platforms: Bloggers can use Future Links to test ideas for future blog posts and prioritize their writing based on reader interest.
- E-books and digital content: Authors can gauge interest in potential book topics or chapters before investing time in writing them.
- Online courses and educational content: Instructors can use Future Links to assess demand for specific course modules or learning materials.
- Substack and other subscription-based platforms: Content creators can use Future Links to validate ideas for future newsletters or exclusive content.

These are just example and are not the only contexts where the idea of Future Lniks miught be useful.

## Immediate Implementation

One of the key advantages of the "Future Links" concept is that it can be implemented immediately without the need for any new technology. Content creators can start using Future Links right away by simply creating Future Content Placeholders with explanatory text.

For example, a content creator could create a Future Link with text similar to:

"Hey! You've reached content that I haven't created yet. If you're interested in seeing this [content placeholder] created, please [placeholder for how to support]."

By using this approach, content creators can gauge interest and gather support for their ideas without having to invest significant time or resources upfront. This allows for a more agile and responsive content creation process that is driven by audience demand.

## Open-Sourcing the Concept

The primary intention behind creating this GitHub repository is to document and articulate the "Future Links" concept in a public, open-source manner. By doing so, we aim to ensure that no one can claim ownership of this idea through patents or other legal means.

I believe that the "Future Links" concept has the potential to benefit content creators and users alike, and it should remain accessible to everyone. By releasing this idea under an open-source license, we encourage individuals, organizations, and communities to freely explore, implement, and build upon the concept without the fear of legal repercussions.
